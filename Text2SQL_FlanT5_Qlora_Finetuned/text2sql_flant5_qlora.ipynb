    "        \n",
    "        - **Tokenization:**\n",
    "            The prompt and response are tokenized without truncation (truncation=False) to capture the full token count.\n",
    "            add_special_tokens=True ensures that any model-specific tokens (like start-of-sequence or end-of-sequence tokens) are included.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - **Token Length Check:**\n",
    "            The function returns True if both the prompt and response have token counts within their respective limits, otherwise False.\n",

    "1. **Splitting the DataFrame:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Function Purpose:**\n",
    "    The `split_dataframe` function divides a DataFrame into three distinct subsets:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Training Set:** Contains 85% of the data (by default).\n",

    "        - **Test Set:** Contains 10% of the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - **Validation Set:** Contains the remaining 5% of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Detailed Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Determine Total Rows:**\n",
    "            - `n = len(df)` calculates the total number of rows in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Calculate Split Indices:**\n",
    "            - **`train_end = int(n * train_frac)`** determines the index where the training data should end.\n",
    "        \n",
    "            - **`test_end = train_end + int(n * test_frac)`** calculates the index where the test data should end, immediately following the training set.\n",

    "    - **Dataset Dictionary:**\n",
    "        A `DatasetDict` is created to organize the datasets under clearly labeled splits: `'train'`, `'test'`, and `'validation'`. This standard structure is widely used in Hugging Face pipelines.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - **Saving:**\n",

    "# Reloading and Tokenizing the Dataset for T5 Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "This code block covers several critical steps to prepare the dataset for fine-tuning a T5 model. It includes reloading a previously merged dataset from disk, initializing the tokenizer, defining a custom tokenization function, and finally either loading an existing tokenized version or creating one if it doesn't exist. Below is a detailed explanation of each part of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reloading the Dataset from Disk:**\n",
    "    - **Purpose:**\n",
    "      The merged dataset, previously saved under the name `\"merged_dataset\"`, is reloaded using the `load_from_disk function`.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - **Logging:**\n",
    "      A sample from the test split of the reloaded dataset is logged. This helps verify that the dataset was loaded correctly and gives a quick glance at the structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initializing the Tokenizer:**\n",
    "    - **Purpose:**\n",
    "        - Sets the model name to `\"google/flan-t5-base\"`, which corresponds to the pre-trained T5 model.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Loads the associated tokenizer using `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained`, ensuring that tokenization is consistent with how the model was originally trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining the Tokenization Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Function Overview:**\n",
    "        - The `tokenize_function` prepares a batch of examples for T5 fine-tuning by constructing a standardized prompt and tokenizing both the prompt and its corresponding response.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Prompt Construction:**\n",
    "        - Three strings (`start_prompt`, `middle_prompt`, and `end_prompt`) define the structure of the prompt.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Each example’s prompt is created by combining the `context` and `query` fields from the batch with these fixed markers.\n",
    "          \n",
    "    - **Tokenization of Inputs and Labels:**\n",
    "        - **Prompts:**\n",
    "            - The constructed prompts are tokenized with a maximum length of 512 tokens, using padding and truncation to ensure uniformity.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - **Responses:**\n",
    "            - The responses are tokenized separately with a maximum length of 256 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Label Preparation:**\n",
    "            - Tokenized responses are processed so that any token matching the pad token ID is replaced with `-100`. This ensures that the loss function will ignore these padded positions during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Updating the Batch:**\n",
    "        - **The function adds three keys to the batch dictionary:**\n",
    "            - `'input_ids'`: The tokenized prompt IDs.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            - `'attention_mask'`: The attention masks corresponding to the prompts.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            - `'labels'`: The processed tokenized responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **The updated batch is then returned.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Loading or Creating the Tokenized Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Purpose:**\n",
    "        - The code attempts to load a pre-tokenized version of the dataset from disk, saved under the name `\"tokenized_datasets\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Error Handling:**\n",
    "        - If the tokenized dataset is not found (which throws an exception), the code logs that it will create a new tokenized dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Dataset Mapping:**\n",
    "        - Uses the map function on the original dataset with the `tokenize_function`:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Batched Processing:**\n",
    "            - `batched=True` allows processing multiple examples at once for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Removing Unnecessary Columns:**\n",
    "            - The original columns query, context, and response are removed after tokenization since they are no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Parallel Processing:**\n",
    "            - `num_proc=8` utilizes 8 processes to speed up the tokenization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Saving:**\n",
    "        - The newly tokenized dataset is saved to disk as `\"tokenized_datasets\"` for future reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Appropriate log messages are generated to confirm the process.\n",
    "     \n",
    "5. **Formatting and Logging the Final Tokenized Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Setting the Format:**\n",
    "        - `tokenized_datasets.set_format(\"torch\")` converts the dataset into a PyTorch-compatible format, which is necessary for efficient training.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Logging the Dataset Structure:**\n",
    "        - The keys of the tokenized dataset (typically `'train'`, `'test'`, and `'validation'`) are logged to verify the available splits.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - A sample record from the training split is also logged to ensure that the tokenization was successful and the data is formatted as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Impact:\n",
    "    - This comprehensive block of code efficiently reloads, tokenizes, and formats the dataset for T5 fine-tuning. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - It leverages robust error handling to either load an existing tokenized dataset or generate a new one when necessary, ensuring that the subsequent training process will proceed smoothly with data in the correct format.\n",

    "\n",
    "This code demonstrates how to perform zero-shot text generation using the pre-trained T5 model (\"google/flan-t5-base\"). The process involves loading the model and its tokenizer, selecting a sample from the test dataset, constructing a prompt, generating a response with the model, and finally printing both the human-provided response and the model's output. Additionally, the memory is cleared at the end to manage GPU resources efficiently.\n",

    "1. ***Model and Tokenizer Initialization:***\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - ***Model Name:***\n",
    "        - The variable model_name is set to `\"google/flan-t5-base\"`, indicating the specific pre-trained T5 model being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Tokenizer Initialization:***\n",
    "        - The tokenizer corresponding to the T5 model is loaded using `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained()`. This ensures that the text is tokenized in a manner consistent with the model’s training.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Model Loading:***\n",
    "        - The T5 model is loaded with the data type `torch.bfloat16` for improved memory efficiency and performance on compatible hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Device Assignment:***\n",
    "        - The model is moved to the computation device (GPU or CPU) specified by the variable `device` to leverage hardware acceleration.\n",
    "          \n",
    "2. ***Selecting a Test Example:***\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Purpose:***\n",
    "        - A single example (at index 0) is selected from the test split of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Data Extraction:***\n",
    "        - The `query`, `context`, and `response` fields are extracted from the chosen test example. These fields represent the input query, accompanying context, and the human-provided response respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Constructing the Input Prompt***\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Prompt Format:***\n",
    "        - A multi-line formatted string (f-string) is created to structure the input prompt.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - ***Decoding:***\n",
    "        - The generated tokens are decoded back into a human-readable string using `tokenizer.decode()`. The parameter `skip_special_tokens=True` removes any special tokens (e.g., `<pad>`, `<eos>`) from the output.\n",

    "5. ***Displaying the Input and Output:***\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Visual Separation:***\n",

    "6. ***Memory Cleanup***\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Purpose:***\n",
    "        - The `clear_memory()` function is called to release unused GPU memory. This is essential in managing resources efficiently, especially after performing memory-intensive operations like model inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This code block establishes a baseline for zero-shot text generation with the T5 model. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - By clearly structuring the prompt, tokenizing input, and generating a response, it sets the stage for comparing the model's performance against human responses. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The process, along with memory management practices, ensures that the system runs efficiently during inference.\n"

    "# Merging and Saving a Fine-Tuned Model with LoRA Adapter\n",
    "\n",
    "This section of code demonstrates how to save a fine-tuned LoRA adapter separately, merge it into the base model to create a fully fine-tuned model, and then save the complete model along with a generation configuration file. Below is an in-depth explanation of every part of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Defining Paths and Model Identifiers:***\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***`base_model_name`:***\n",
    "        - Specifies the identifier for the pre-trained T5 model provided by Google (`google/flan-t5-base`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***`lora_model_path`:***\n",
    "        - Indicates the directory where the fine-tuned LoRA adapter is stored. This adapter contains the additional parameters that were updated during fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***`full_model_output_path`:***\n",
    "        - Defines the directory where the final merged model (base model with integrated LoRA adapter) will be saved.\n",
    "        This full model can be used for inference without needing to load the adapter separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Loading the Base Model and Tokenizer:***\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Base Model Loading:***\n",
    "        - The base T5 model is loaded using `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained` with a specified data type (`torch.bfloat16`) to optimize memory usage and computational performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Tokenizer Loading:***\n",
    "        - The corresponding tokenizer is loaded to ensure that text is pre-processed consistently with the model's requirements.\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. ***Loading the Fine-Tuned LoRA Adapter:***\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Purpose:***\n",
    "        - This line loads the fine-tuned LoRA adapter into the base model. The adapter contains modifications tailored to a specific task (e.g., text-to-SQL) and enables efficient fine-tuning by updating only a small subset of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Mechanism:***\n",
    "        - `PeftModel.from_pretrained` wraps the base model with the fine-tuned LoRA adapter parameters stored at `lora_model_path`.\n",
    "     \n",
    "4. ***Saving the LoRA Adapter Separately:***\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Why Save Separately?***\n",
    "        - Saving the LoRA adapter by itself allows users who need a lightweight model for further fine-tuning or deployment to load only the adapter parameters rather than the entire model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Actions:***\n",
    "        - The LoRA adapter and the associated tokenizer are saved to `lora_model_path` using their respective `save_pretrained` methods.\n",
    "     \n",
    "5. ***Merging the LoRA Adapter with the Base Model:***\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Purpose:***\n",
    "        - The merging process integrates the LoRA adapter parameters into the base model. After merging, the model becomes fully fine-tuned and no longer requires the separate adapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Method:***\n",
    "        - `merge_and_unload() combines the adapter weights with the base model’s weights and then unloads the adapter, resulting in a standalone, fully fine-tuned model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ***Saving the Fully Merged Fine-Tuned Model:***\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Purpose:***\n",
    "        - After merging, the complete fine-tuned model (now including the LoRA modifications) is saved to disk for future inference or deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Actions:***\n",
    "        - The `save_pretrained` method is called on both the merged model and the tokenizer, storing them at `full_model_output_path`.\n",
    "     \n",
    "7. ***Saving the Generation Configuration:***\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Purpose:***\n",
    "        - Saving a generation configuration is optional but highly recommended. It ensures that inference settings (such as maximum tokens to generate, temperature, beam search settings, etc.) are preserved and can be loaded alongside the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Configuration Details:***\n",
    "        - ***`max_new_tokens`:***\n",
    "            - Limits the number of tokens the model will generate in a single inference call.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - ***`temperature`:***\n",
    "            - Controls the randomness of predictions; a lower value (0.1) makes the output more deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - ***`num_beams`:***\n",
    "            - Specifies the number of beams used in beam search for more diverse and high-quality generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - ***`early_stopping`:***\n",
    "            -  Enables stopping the generation process early if certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ***Saving Process:***\n",
    "        - The configuration dictionary is saved as a JSON file in the model output directory, allowing for easy retrieval during inference\n",
