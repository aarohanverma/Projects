# Model Card

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->

This model is a fine-tuned version of [Flan-T5 Base](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base) optimized to convert natural language queries into SQL statements. It leverages **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)** with PEFT for efficient adaptation and has been trained on a concatenation of several high-quality text-to-SQL datasets. A live demo is available, and users can clone and run inference directly from Hugging Face.

## Model Details

### Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->

This model is designed to generate SQL queries based on a provided natural language context and query. 
It has been fine-tuned using QLoRA with 4-bit quantization and PEFT on a diverse text-to-SQL dataset. 
The model demonstrates significant improvements over the original base model, making it highly suitable for practical text-to-SQL applications.

- **Model type:** Seq2Seq / Text-to-Text Generation (SQL Generation)
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English
- **License:** Apache-2.0
- **Finetuned from model:** [google/flan-t5-base](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base)


### Model Sources

<!-- Provide the basic links for the model. -->

- **Repository:** [https://huggingface.co/aarohanverma/text2sql-flan-t5-base-qlora-finetuned](https://huggingface.co/aarohanverma/text2sql-flan-t5-base-qlora-finetuned)

## Uses

<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->

### Direct Use

<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->

This model can be used directly for generating SQL queries from natural language inputs. 
It is particularly useful for applications in database querying and natural language interfaces for relational databases.

### Downstream Use 

<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->

The model can be further integrated into applications such as chatbots, data analytics platforms, and business intelligence tools to automate query generation.

### Out-of-Scope Use

<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->

This model is not designed for tasks outside text-to-SQL generation. 
It may not perform well for non-SQL language generation or queries outside the domain of structured data retrieval.

## Risks and Limitations

<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->

- **Risks:** Inaccurate SQL generation may lead to unexpected query behavior, especially in safety-critical environments.
- **Limitations:** The model may struggle with highly complex schemas and queries due to limited training data and inherent model capability constraints, particularly for tasks that require deep, domain-specific knowledge.

### Recommendations

<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->

Users should validate the generated SQL queries before deployment in production systems. 
Consider incorporating human-in-the-loop review for critical applications.

## How to Get Started with the Model

To get started, clone the repository or download the model from Hugging Face, then use the provided example code to run inference.

## Training Details

### Training Data

<!-- This should link to a Dataset Card, perhaps with a short stub of information on what the training data is all about as well as documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering. -->

The model was fine-tuned on a concatenation of several publicly available text-to-SQL datasets:
1. **[Clinton/Text-to-SQL v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Clinton/Text-to-sql-v1)**
2. **[b-mc2/sql-create-context](https://huggingface.co/datasets/b-mc2/sql-create-context)**
3. **[gretelai/synthetic_text_to_sql](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gretelai/synthetic_text_to_sql)**
4. **[knowrohit07/know_sql](https://huggingface.co/datasets/knowrohit07/know_sql)**

**Data Split:**

| **Split**            | **Percentage**     | **Number of Samples**    |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **Training**         | 85%                | **338,708**              |

### Training Procedure

<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications. Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->

#### Preprocessing

The raw data was preprocessed as follows:
- **Cleaning:** Removal of extra whitespaces/newlines and standardization of columns (renaming to `query`, `context`, and `response`).
- **Filtering:** Dropping examples with missing values and duplicates; retaining only rows where the prompt is ‚â§ 500 tokens and the response is ‚â§ 250 tokens.
- **Tokenization:**

Prompts are constructed in the format:
```
Context:
{context}

Query:
{query}

Response:
```
and tokenized with a maximum length of 512 for inputs and 256 for responses using [google/flan-t5-base](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base)'s tokenizer.

#### Training Hyperparameters

- **Epochs:** 6  
- **Batch Sizes:**  
  Training: 64 per device  
  Evaluation: 64 per device  
- **Gradient Accumulation:** 2 steps  
- **Learning Rate:** 2e-4  
- **Optimizer:** `adamw_bnb_8bit` (memory-efficient variant of AdamW)  
- **LR Scheduler:** Cosine scheduler with a warmup ratio of 10%

## Evaluation

<!-- This section describes the evaluation protocols and provides the results. -->

The model was evaluated on 39,848 test samples, representing 10% of the dataset.

#### Metrics

<!-- These are the evaluation metrics being used, ideally with a description of why. -->

Evaluation metrics used:
- **ROUGE:** Measures n-gram overlap between generated and reference SQL.
- **BLEU:** Assesses the quality of translation from natural language to SQL.
- **Fuzzy Match Score:** Uses token-set similarity to provide a soft match percentage.
- **Exact Match Accuracy:** Percentage of queries that exactly match the reference SQL.

### Results

## üîç Inference & Example Usage

### Inference Code
Below is the recommended Python code for running inference on the fine-tuned model:

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Ensure device is set (GPU if available)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Load the fine-tuned model and tokenizer
model_name = "aarohanverma/text2sql-flan-t5-base-qlora-finetuned"
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to(device)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("aarohanverma/text2sql-flan-t5-base-qlora-finetuned")

# Ensure decoder start token is set
if model.config.decoder_start_token_id is None:
    model.config.decoder_start_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id

def run_inference(prompt_text: str) -> str:
    """
    Runs inference on the fine-tuned model using beam search with fixes for repetition.
    """
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt_text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=512).to(device)

    generated_ids = model.generate(
        input_ids=inputs["input_ids"],
        decoder_start_token_id=model.config.decoder_start_token_id, 
        max_new_tokens=100,  
        temperature=0.1,  
        num_beams=5,  
        repetition_penalty=1.2,  
        early_stopping=True, 
    )

    generated_sql = tokenizer.decode(generated_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

    generated_sql = generated_sql.split(";")[0] + ";"  # Keep only the first valid SQL query

    return generated_sql

# Example usage:
context = (
    "CREATE TABLE students (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100), age INT, grade CHAR(1)); "
    "INSERT INTO students (id, name, age, grade) VALUES "
    "(1, 'Alice', 14, 'A'), (2, 'Bob', 15, 'B'), "
    "(3, 'Charlie', 14, 'A'), (4, 'David', 16, 'C'), (5, 'Eve', 15, 'B');"
)

query = ("Retrieve the names of students who are 15 years old.")


# Construct the prompt
sample_prompt = f"""Context:
{context}

Query:
{query}

Response:
"""

logger.info("Running inference with beam search decoding.")
generated_sql = run_inference(sample_prompt)

print("Prompt:")
print("Context:")
print(context)
print("\nQuery:")
print(query)
print("\nResponse:")
print(generated_sql)

# EXPECTED RESPONSE: SELECT name FROM students WHERE age = 15; 
```
